This project contains a minimal build-helper MCP server for Kiro.

Before running setup.py, make sure you’re on the latest commit. If not, run git pull.
Use python3 setup.py to install.
If the setup fails, you are most likely on an outdated Git release. Update Git to the latest version instead of modifying the code yourself.
